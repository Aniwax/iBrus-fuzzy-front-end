# Here stores the developer's note while exploring the mesh libraries.

## Nov. 30 - Dec 4th
1. rtree is needed for using blender engine and boolean operations in trimesh.
2. 


## Dec. 7th, searching for mesh libraries that is related to trimesh or more efficient on boolean calculations
Candidate:

1. Vedo,  https://github.com/marcomusy/vedo/tree/af7553dc04283e001cb03f910cfaf00f4682eb86
boolean based on VTK. [! VTK]:https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkBooleanOperationPolyDataFilter.html

2. Libigl: https://github.com/libigl

3. CGAL  https://www.cgal.org/  The problem is this might be too heavy
