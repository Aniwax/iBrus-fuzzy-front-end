# iBrus-fuzzy-front-end
This repository hosts all the code examples generated while exploring different mesh libraries for fast implementation of boolean operations, collisions, etc. The focus is to find an efficient gemoetric calculation library based on C/C++/C*, that solves the iBurs problems efficiently.

## List of library explored:
1. Trimesh https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh
2. Vedo https://github.com/marcomusy/vedo
